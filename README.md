## AI Image Creation

Conejoz implements by default the OpenJourney's Stable Difussion model to create images from text input. The option to use other models will be available in the future.

## Customizable Themes

Conejoz has a collection of themes just as a code editor. More themes are in the process, if you would like to see a specific theme please let me know.

## Note Taking

## Public Dreams Feed

This public database is optimized to work as a dream explorer by using tags related to the entry. This allows you to locate specific topics of interest within the database.
